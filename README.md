# Land Parcel in PRD

We visualized the land transaction data in the Pearl River Delta in China, from year 2000 to 2017. There are totally 10,505 land parcels, which cover six cities: Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Dongguan, Foshan, Zhuhai, and Zhongshan.

## Tidy the data set
We only keep attributes which may be used in the future research. The raw data contains 85 attributes for each land parcel. However, only part of them are meaningful. I examined them one by one. Then only 35 of them are kept.

## Geocoding
We adopted Google Map or Baidu Map API to get the geographical information of each land parcel.
